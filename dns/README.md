## DNS

I am utilizing some free services provided by several DDNS hosts... some are more gracious than others and let me use many different DNS record types

* freemyip.com - allows for TXT and A records but not much else 

    - used for colaco.freemyip.com

* cloudns.net - allows for a bunch of uncommon DNS record types 

    - used for sugarush.cloudns.ph

* dynv6.com - allows for several of the most commonly used record types 

    - used for colaco.v6.rocks


I bought the domain ColaCo.website 

It is using Cloudflare to manage, proxy, and cache it's DNS records
